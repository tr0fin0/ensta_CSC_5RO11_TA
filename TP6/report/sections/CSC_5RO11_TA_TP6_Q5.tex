\section{X-ray Examen Analysis}
\noindent The X-ray test was likely needed because the stethoscope test was negative, and the X-ray provides additional information, particularly for \textbf{Tuberculosis} and \textbf{Cancer}. The negative stethoscope result would have made the doctor less confident about the diagnosis, and the X-ray provided a way to rule out or confirm \textbf{Tuberculosis} or \textbf{Cancer}.\\

\noindent Thus, based on the process of diagnostic reasoning and the updated probabilities after each test, the X-ray was an important diagnostic tool.
