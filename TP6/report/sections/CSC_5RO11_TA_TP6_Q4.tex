\section{X-ray Examen}
\noindent Given that the X-ray is positive, the possibility of tuberculosis or cancer becomes more likely, as the test is designed to detect these diseases:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item if the X-ray is positive, then the probabilities for \textbf{Tuberculosis} and \textbf{Cancer} should be updated using Bayes' theorem.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent Given that the X-ray test has a sensitivity of $70\%$, a positive result increases the probability of either \textbf{Cancer} or \textbf{Tuberculosis}, so these diseases are now more likely than before.
